## Note to contributors
Keep in mind [I am](https://github.com/leopere/) preferential to receiving patches over rule following as we can always nudge you in the right direction to get things more compatible with the project ethos if it's not.  Never be afraid to file a PR no one should be offended.  This said following the next two guides will greatly improve the speed at which we can integrate your improvements.
* [Repository Standards]( https://lbry.tech/resources/repository-standards)
* [Contribute](https://lbry.tech/contribute)
* Have a LBC wallet ready as we want you to have some for the help! Hell why not post it in your Commit or Merge Request for all I care but take your tips!
